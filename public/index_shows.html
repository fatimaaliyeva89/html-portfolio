<h1>Fatima's TV Show Recommendations</h1>
<h2>Her most favourite 5 TV shows of all time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
    <p>This drama show has a captivating and complicated story line that takes place in a medieval setting. It narrates a story of many various families of lords and ladies who are fighting over power. Some fight more fairly than others. <br />
    Fatima has watched this show 3 times from beginning to end. No, it is a not waste of time. </p>

<h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>This is a comedy series narrating a somewhat funny and ridiculous story of 3 scientists with PhDs and Howard Wolowitz, merely a MSc from MIT in Engineering. They are all very nerdy and awkward, and have a hard time making friends outside of their inner circle or date for that matter. However, they all end up marrying with gorgeous women, some of which are scientists and one is merely the girl next door, like Penny, who doesn't have a surname. </p>

<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
<p>Now this show is something entirely different. It is not following one single story line, rather each episode tells its own story. However, one common theme across all episodes is how technology changed our lives in a dystopian way. <br /> 
I especially loved the episode where you can carry on with life in the cloud, and lead an eternally careless and free life.</p>

<h3>Downton Abbey</h3>
<p>Now I always love a good British show. They are just classy. This one narrates a story of an aristocratic family that over time experiences their wealth and influence dwindle in an increasingly changing and modernizing world.<br />
One thing I especially love about this show is all the amazing hats women wear in the show. Come on, it is classy.
</p>

<h3>Dexter</h3>
<p>Arguably, Dexter is one of the best shows ever made narrating the story of a psychopathic serial killer who actually chooses his victims based on his moral value system. His sister and only surviving kin (he is actually an adoptee) is a successful police officer, who is after him without knowing it. <br />
Dexter kills and dumps most of his victims bodies in the sea, but that comes back haunting him at some point.
