<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and enthusiastic human being with a knack for all things customer-facing. Recently, I have been 
  struggling with the current job market which is why I am looking for ways to add to my skillset by learning programming
  with Angela Wu. I believe I have enough credentials to master this skillset as long as I put enough hours to practice 
  and learn programming.</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I also have a full time job working with customers and building strong relationships across 
  the board on the customer side and internally. I have a decade of experience at technology companies working both in 
  Berlin, Germany and SF bay, Unites States. </p>

<p>Outside of work, I love being active, going for walks and runs, cycling occasionally, doing strength workouts, traveling, 
  cooking, hanging out with my husband Cem and our sweet cat boy Lionel. I am a citizen of Germany and I would love to move 
  back to Europe in the next few years to be close to family and friends.</p>
